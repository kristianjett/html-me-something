            <p>I've had the joy of meeting so many dogs in my life.
                These are just a handful that have had an impact on me. 
                (And also that I have easy access to photos.)

            <h2>Kalani</h2>
            <img src="">
            <p>Kalani is honestly the best dog in the entire world. He was adopted about five years ago, 
                and having him around has made the last five years so much fluffier. Kalani is a loving
                Golden Doodle who enjoys mangoes, carrots, and pumpkin. (I think I'm seeing a color trend here...)
